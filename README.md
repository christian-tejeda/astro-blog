# Astro Blog

A personal blog client application made with [Astro](https://astro.build/) (based off their blog template). Deployment available on [Vercel](https://astro-blog-alpha.vercel.app/).

Each page follows a file-based routing, meaning each `.astro/.md` file has its own route. Blog entries written in Markdown get a layout applied automatically.
